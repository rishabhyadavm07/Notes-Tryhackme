# Metasploit: Exploitation

1. first thing in mind comes when you get a ip is to scan that ip 
2. found smb and wasted a lot of time thinking that how to enumerate smb 
3. frustation made me click the hint and it tells that the machine has not installed the eternal blue patch and is vulnerable 
4. but me as a big noob enumerated more harder to see how can i get to know that machine has a eternal blue vulnerablity 
5. and got nothing instead of small knowledge of enumerating harder 
6. went with the hint and ran the metasploit module for exploiting eternal blue vulnerablity 
7. got a shell with system privilages 
8. the last 2 questions are really in control now and now as the question 2 stated 
9. located the file with the command {SEARCH } and found the file .
10. question 2 done 
11. question 3 asks for the NTLM hash of a user 
12. simply type hashdump and book here are the hashes for all the users
13. the mistake i made was that i was pasting the whole hash in the answer box 
14. WRONG  !
15. the last code that is between 2 ":" are the answer for the question ie. [:************:::]
16. DONE
