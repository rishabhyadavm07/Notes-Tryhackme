8. found the exploit on exploit-db and downloaded it and ran it.
9. HARD LUCK !
10. downloaded more exploits that i found on github and searchsploit. STILL NO LUCK 
11.frustation ya right ! searched for the room walkthrough 
12. read the walkthrough and saw the questions again
13. finally found why the question was suggesting me to use attackbox becz it already had the exploit made and ready to use.
14. the author of the walkthrough had also uploaded the exploit file on his github 
15. then,just cloned the exploit from github and as told to start the netcat listening on port of choice 
16. ran the exploit with the ip of the webapp and provided it with the attckerip and port on which the listener is listening on 
17. GOTCHA  !
18. got the shell and easily traversed to the home/ubuntu folder and concatenated the flag.txt file 
19. COPY + PASTE = SATISFACTION !
